# Handling-Imbalanced-Data-in-Building-Energy-Benchmarking-2022
This repository includes the analysis and report of a machine learning study performed within an academic conference: The 7th International Project and Construction Management Conference, IPCMC 2022. The study performs building energy benchmarking over an imbalanced dataset using several machine learning models and aims to reduce the classification loss by employing a cost-sensitive approach.
